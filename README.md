# router-on-a-stick-lab
This project demonstrates a small-scale network topology using Router-on-a-Stick configuration.
The setup includes:
Router-on-a-Stick for inter-VLAN routing.
Multiple VLANs configured on the switch to separate traffic.
Telnet & SSH configured for remote device management.
DHCP service enabled on the router to dynamically assign IP addresses to end devices.
End devices are connected and verified for communication across VLANs.
The project is built and tested using Cisco Packet Tracer.
